# FCGAN
This page shows some results of new experiments conducted in IJCAI 2019 rebuttal period. Details can be seen in rebuttal context.

## 1.Evaluation of different source objects
For IJCAI 2019 rebuttal, we conduct extensive experiments for different source objects and show their performance on this page. These experiments are divided as four parts, including Image generation in FCGAN, Feature map visualization for each convolutional layers, t-SNE and PCA plot for extracted features, and Occlusion test to find the important discriminative area FCGAN focusing.
 
### 1.1 Image generation in FCGAN

### 1.2 Feature map visualization for each convolutional layers

### 1.3 t-SNE and PCA plot for extracted features

### 1.4 Occlusion test

## 2.Additional compared experiments
Furthermore, we also conduct some other experiments to show the effectiveness of our model. The first is using a pre-trained mode by Imagenet to extract features for T.gondii images, and the second is to replace Cycle GAN in our FCGAN by a GAN. The results of these two compared methods are as follows:

### 2.1 Pre-trained by ImageNet

### 2.3 GAN based model

## 3.Average pulling loss
